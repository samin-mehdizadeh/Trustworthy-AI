# Trustworthy-AI
This repository contains the assignments for my Trustworthy AI course projects.
* Adversarial Training: trained a robust model using adversarial examples and angular loss.
* Black-box Explainability: explained black-box models using various techniques, including Shapley values and LIME.
* Exploiting Model Vulnerability: conducted an attack on a model using adversarial examples and employed patches to create a backdoor within the model.
